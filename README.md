# GrAMPS GraphQL Data Source Base
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gramps-graphql/data-source-base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gramps-graphql/data-source-base) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/ac264833fac1fbd1afe0/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/gramps-graphql/data-source-base/maintainability) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/ac264833fac1fbd1afe0/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/gramps-graphql/data-source-base/test_coverage) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@gramps/data-source-base.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gramps/data-source-base) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/gramps-graphql/data-source-base.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a minimal example and boilerplate for a GrAMPS data source. Inside, youâ€™ll find:

 -  **Context** â€” an object with methods to retrieve/modify data from the data 
    source (e.g. a CRUD wrapper)
 -  **Schema** â€” type definitions for GraphQL to interpret the data (see the 
    [GraphQL docs on schemas](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/))
 -  **Resolvers** â€” functions to map the results of calls to model methods to
    the schema
 -  **Mock Resolvers** â€” mock functions for offline development

Each file contains a `TODO` comment explaining the changes youâ€™ll need to make to create a working data source.

The goal of this repo is to provide enough code to allow a working example of a data source and its related tests, but to limit how much boilerplate needs to be edited to get your own data source implemented.

## Code Quality and Continuous Integration

To help ensure a reliable, easy-to-maintain data source, this example also includes:

 -  Configuration for Travis CI (for automated testing) and Code Climate
    (for quality analysis)
 -  Starts you off right with test coverage at ðŸ’¯
 -  Provides testing helpers for common resolver testing patterns
 -  Comes with docs! https://ibm.biz/graphql-data-source

## Quickstart

**NOTE:** Replace all instances of `YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME` with the actual name you want to use (e.g. `data-source-companyname-datatype`).

```sh
# Get a copy of the data source
npx degit gramps-graphql/data-source-base data-source-YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME

# Move into it
cd data-source-YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME/

# IMPORTANT: Make sure to edit the name, description, contributors, and 
# repository fields in package.json

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start the dev server
yarn dev
```

You'll see a message with URLs for the GraphQL gateway and the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground). Open the Playground link (usually http://localhost:8080/playground if you donâ€™t already have something running on port 8080), then run a query:

```graphql
{
  getById(id: 123) {
    id
    name
    lucky_numbers
  }
}
```

### To Develop with Mock Data

Start the app with the following command:

```sh
# Start the gateway with mock data
yarn dev --mock
```

### Notes for Developers

Currently, there is no watch capability (PRs welcome!), so the service needs to be stopped (`control` + `C`) and restarted (`yarn dev`) to reflect new changes to the data source.
